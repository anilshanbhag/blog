{"pages":[{"title":"Credit reports and security in the offline world","url":"/2017/12/04/equifax/","text":"Credit score is a number almost every individual in the country cares about. Your credit score determines if you can get a particular credit card, how much interest you pay on a loan, etc. Credit scores are calculated based on your credit report, an exhaustive account of all your past dealings with financial entities. There are 3 major credit reporting agencies in the US: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. The law requires each of these nationwide credit reporting companies to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. Given the private nature of this information, you would assume they have mechanisms to let you access this information securely. TransUnion and Experian allow you access it online or mail, but for Equifax says the only way to get your report is via snail mail. What! why would anyone in 2017 send credit reports by mail; it insecure, can easily end up get lost / misplaced / in the hands of an identity thief. Below are two pages from an Equifax credit report I accidently ended up recieving. By the virtue of getting access to the report, I now know the person’s last 4 digits of SSN, bank account numbers, addresses, dob, etc. The following information in the hands of the wrong person can cause some serious damage. The recent Equifax hack was an eye-opener. We suddenly came to know the gross incompetence of these agencies. Equifax ended up firing their Chief Security Officer who was a music major. Above example shows that these agencies still live in stone age and are not geared to ensure security and privacy of private information. Confidential information should not be sent via mail period. This is not the first post on this topic; hope some day these agencies mend their ways.","tags":"security"},{"title":"Analyzing the 2016 elections","url":"/2017/09/05/Analyzing-the-2016-elections/","text":"Elections are a treat for data enthusiasts. This elections, even more so ! Every single poll in the US predicted a landslide for Hillary Clinton. Below is an infographic from the New York Times: The chances of Trump winning Presidency before results started coming out was around 15% ! Everyone got it wrong and in the end he won 306 seats. Being curious, I download the data from AP and turned on my Jupyter notebook. The truth is this could have been a lot worse! The elections had two major candidates: Hillary Clinton from the Democratic Party and Donald Trump from the Republican Party. But in the fray were many other candidates, two of which took a good share (&gt;1%) of the vote share: Jill Stein from the Green Party and Gary Johnson from the Libertarian Party. The Green party is more liberal than the Democratic; the Libertarians are more conservative than Republicans. If we consolidate the votes of Hillary+Stein vs Gary+Donald i.e.: making a two candidate race, the Dems would have lost 5 more states == 33 more seats. They would lose in Colorado, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada and Maine. Trump would have gotten 339 seats — a landslide. The map at the top shows how it would look like if that happened. This is truly surprising. Living at MIT in Boston, I have so far spoken to 1 Trump supporter. It is like I so far lived in a bubble. In fact a lot of places have very few supporters of either party. From the data, here are the 10 places with the lowest vote percentage for Hillary and for Trump: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425Schema: County, State: Hillary-Vote Percentage, Trump-Vote Percentage,Counties with lowest Hillary Clinton Vote PercentageKing County, TX: 3.140000, 93.710000Roberts County, TX: 3.640000, 95.270000Banner County, NE: 4.620000, 91.030000Garfield County, MT: 4.750000, 91.200000McPherson County, NE: 4.900000, 89.860000Harding County, SD: 4.940000, 90.250000Piute County, UT: 5.020000, 87.030000Grant County, NE: 5.080000, 93.150000Glasscock County, TX: 5.650000, 91.860000Wallace County, KS: 5.780000, 91.270000Counties with lowest Donald Trump Vote PercentageDistrict of Columbia County, DC: 92.850000, 4.120000Oglala Lakota County, SD: 86.460000, 8.320000Prince Georges County, MD: 89.330000, 8.340000Bronx County, NY: 88.730000, 9.590000San Francisco County, CA: 85.350000, 9.730000New York County, NY: 87.170000, 9.970000Petersburg city, VA: 87.520000, 10.560000Baltimore city, MD: 85.440000, 10.870000Jefferson County, MS: 86.470000, 12.670000Clayton County, GA: 85.060000, 13.160000 Boston was a close contender for Top 10. New York, SF and other urban centers are heavily Democratic which is probably what made us feel Hillary was going to sweep. In fact, when we check places with more than 0.5 million votes cast, Hillary wins 33 of them compared to just 3 for Trump. The only ones Trump wins are: 123Maricopa County AZSuffolk County NYTarrant County TX One positive effect of elections was that it showed that it is not always the person with more money who wins. From a previous /r/dataisbeautiful post: Getting the DataThe Associated Press releases data for the elections. While not free, I found that JSON endpoints powering their election interactive can be downloaded (it is public). All the data and the notebook with the code can be found here.
