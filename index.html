Your credit score determines if you can get a particular credit card, how much interest you pay on a loan, etc.  Credit scores are calculated based on your credit report, an exhaustive account of all your past dealings with financial entities. </p>
<p>There are 3 major credit reporting agencies in the US: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. The <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports" target="_blank" rel="external">law</a> requires each of these nationwide credit reporting companies to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. Given the private nature of this information, you would assume they have mechanisms to let you access this information securely. TransUnion and Experian allow you access it online or mail, but for Equifax says the only way to get your report is via snail mail. What! why would anyone in 2017 send credit reports by mail; it insecure, can easily end up get lost / misplaced / in the hands of an identity thief. Below are two pages from an Equifax credit report I accidently ended up recieving. </p></div><a href="/2017/12/04/equifax/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/09/05/Analyzing-the-2016-elections/" class="post-title-link">Analyzing the 2016 elections</a></h2><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/politics/" class="tag-title">#politics</a><a href="/tags/data-analysis/" class="tag-title">#data-analysis</a></div><div class="post-info">Sep 5, 2017</div><div class="post-content"><p>Elections are a treat for data enthusiasts.

<p>The chances of Trump winning Presidency before results started coming out was around 15% ! Everyone got it wrong and in the end he won 306 seats. Being curious, I download the data from AP and turned on my Jupyter notebook. The truth is this could have been a lot worse!<br></div><a href="/2017/09/05/Analyzing-the-2016-elections/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li></ul></main><footer><div class="paginator"><span class="page-number current">1</span></div><div class="copyright"><p>Â© 2017 - 2019 <a href="http://blog.anilshanbhag.in">Anil Shanbhag</a>, powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MikeCoder/hexo-theme-gandalfr" target="_blank">hexo-theme-gandalfr</a>.</p></div></footer></div><script src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha384-crwIf/BuaWM9rM65iM+dWFldgQ1Un8jWZMuh3puxb8TOY9+linwLoI7ZHZT+aekW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.9.0/highlight.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="//cdn.bootcss.com/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script>$(document).ready(function() { $('pre').each(function(i, block) { hljs.highlightBlock(block); }); });</script></body></html>
